# Getting started {#getting_started}

```{r setup010, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# path to this file name
if (!interactive()) {
    fnamepath <- current_input(dir = TRUE)
} else {
    fnamepath <- ""
}
```

Before we start, make sure that you have opened RStudio and QGIS on your computer.

## Install necessary packages

The most important packages We will be using for the GIS work are [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html), [`raster`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html),  [`leaflet`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/), and [`rgdal`](). To install these and others that we will be using, enter at the R console prompt (or copy-and-paste):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
    c(
        "sf",
        "raster",
        "leaflet",
        "rgdal",
        "kableExtra",
        "leaflet",
        "dplyr",
        "pander",
        "knitr",
        "kableExtra",
        "tidycensus",
        "ggplot2",
        "forcats",
        "mapview"
    )
)
```

This should only need to be done once on any user R installation.

## Create an RStudio project

Create a new RStudio project in a new folder on your desktop named `r_gis` (`File` > `New Project`).

__Create a few folders__

Use the `Files` pane and create three new folders names `scripts`, `data`, and `rmd`. These will be used to store various files in an organized fashion.

__Create an R Markdown file___

Create a new R script (`File > New File > R Markdown...)`

Delete most of the content

![](images/2020-02-12_09_32_29-C__Users_phurvitz_Desktop_r_gis - RStudio.png)

And save it as `r_gis.Rmd` in your `rmd` folder.

![](images/2020-02-12_09_33_46-Save File - Untitled1.png)

This is the file that will store the code for this workshop.

In the `setup` chunk, add these lines for the packages we will be using:

```
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(leaflet)
library(pander)
library(sf)
library(tidycensus)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(mapview)
```

and then save the Rmd file. Continue adding to the file as we progress, by copying code chunks from this book to your Rmd file.

## Download files

Download some files into the `data` folder you just created:

* [MetroKC transportation features](https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/r_gis/data/Metro_Transportation_Network_TNET_in_King_County__trans_network_line.zip)
* [MetroKC transit stops](https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/r_gis/data/busstop_SHP.zip)
* [KC GIS medical facilities](https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/r_gis/data/medical_facilities_SHP.zip)
* [KC GIS waterbodies](https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/r_gis/data/wtrbdy_SHP.zip)
* [Esri ZIP code polygons](https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/r_gis/data/zip_poly.gdb.zip)
* [Seattle community reporting areas](https://staff.washington.edu/phurvitz/r_gis/data/Community_Reporting_Areas.zip)

After you have downloaded the files, unzip them. The most efficient way to do this is to select all the files, R-click one of them, and then select `7-Zip` > `Extract Here`. 

![](images/2020-02-10 17_38_04-.png)

You should now have a collection of files in your `data` folder, including the ones you downloaded.

## Preview data
In QGIS, create a new project (`Project` > `New` or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-N`).

Make sure the `Browser` panel is available (`View` > `Panels `Browser`). This will make it easier to add layers to the project. Also make sure the `Layer Styling` panel is checked, which will enable you to quickly modify layer display properties.

Next, make a shortcut to the `data` folder by R-clicking `Favorites`, selecting `Add a Directory` and navigating the the `data` folder.

![](images/2020-02-10_18_03_19-Add Directory to Favorites.png)

Expand all of the folders, and select the data sources you just downloaded and drag them onto the map display.

![](images/2020-02-10_18_08_58-Untitled Project - QGIS.png)

If you get dialogs for `Select Datum Transformations`, click __OK__.

The data set of ZIP code areas covers the entire US, so it may take some time to display them; to speed up the display process, R-click any of the King County layers and select `Zoom to Layer`.

Alter any of the layer display properties if the colors hurt your eyes.

## Save your project

Save the QGIS project in a new folder named `qgis`; ___Bonus___: What is the significance of the file name I used?

## Conclusion
Now that the preliminary steps are complete, we can move on to the remainder of the material.
