# Representation of spatial features {#representation}

```{r setup020, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# path to this file name
if (!interactive()) {
    fnamepath <- current_input(dir = TRUE)
} else {
    fnamepath <- ""
}
```

Vector (point, line, and polygon) features as used in the `sf` package are compliant with the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa) standard.

To start, let's load the `sf` and `dplyr` packages .

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
```

## Points {#points}
Points are stored as X and Y coordinates. In the folliwing code chunk we make a `sf` data frame from one point at the longitude and latitude representing the Space Needle. The option `crs = 4326` specifies to register the X and Y coordinates to WGS84 ([EPSG code 4326](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/)). More attention will be paid to coordinate systems in Chapter  \@ref(crs).


```{r sn1}
snxy <- data.frame(name = "Space Needle", x = -122.3493, y = 47.6205)
space_needle <- st_as_sf(snxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)
```

We can see a complete description of the data frame, which includes the geometry type, dimension, bounding box coordinates, spatial reference ID ("SRID") and proj4 projection definition, and finally the contents of the data frame, incuding the column `geometry` that shows the longitude and latitude.

Importantly, the `sf` data frame is an extension of the data frame model. The data frame can consist of the same type of data you have been using in R, but with the addition of columns that contain OGC representations of vector features.

```{r sn2}
print(space_needle)
```

The coordinates of the point can be extracted using the `st_coordinates()` function:

```{r sn3}
st_coordinates(space_needle)
```

Let's add the coordinates of Savery Hall:

```{r sav1}
shxy <- data.frame(name = "Savery Hall", x = -122.3083, y = 47.6572)
savery_hall <- st_as_sf(shxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)

# rbind() to put two points in one data frame
pts <- rbind(space_needle, savery_hall)
```

View the data frame:

```{r pts1}
print(pts)
```

View the points in coordinate space:

```{r pts2}
plot(pts$geometry, axes = TRUE, las = 1)
```

## Linestrings
Linestrings are linear features created a single set of ordered pairs of points. We can use the set of points we created to generate a simple linestring `sf` data frame with two vertices:

```{r ls}
# create a linestring sf data frame
lnstr <- st_sfc(st_linestring(st_coordinates(pts)), crs = 4326)
```

As with the point data frame we can add columns:

```{r ls2}
lnstr <- as_tibble(lnstr) %>% mutate(od = "Space Needle, Savery Hall")
```

And plot the points and linestring with base R graphics:

```{r pts-ls}
plot(pts$geometry, axes = TRUE, las = 1)
text(x = st_coordinates(pts), labels = pts$name)
plot(lnstr$geometry, col = 2, add = TRUE)
```

Of course, linestrings can have any number of vertices > 1. ___Bonus___: How would you construct a set of linestrings representing distinct days of GPS data collected from one study subject?

## Polygons
Polygons are ordered collections of XY coordinates with at least 4 vertices. In order for the polygon to "close", the first and last vertices need to be at the same XY location.

Let's add another point to our collection:

```{r zoo}
zooxy <- data.frame(name = "Woodland Park Zoo", x = -122.3543, y = 47.6685)
wp_zoo <- st_as_sf(zooxy, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)

# rbind() to put two points in one data frame
pts <- rbind(pts, wp_zoo)
```

And construct a polygon using the coordinates of the set of three points and closed with a ccopy of the first point

```{r plygn}
(plygn <- st_sfc(st_polygon(list(st_coordinates(rbind(pts, space_needle)))), crs = 4326))
```

Plotted with the other features:

```{r plotgeoms}
plot(plygn, col = "cyan", axes = TRUE, las = 1)
plot(lnstr$geometry, col = 2, add = TRUE, lwd = 3)
plot(pts$geometry, add = TRUE, cex = 2)
text(x = st_coordinates(pts), labels = pts$name)
```

## Conclusion
It is more likely that you will be obtaining GIS data sources, rather than constructing your own using the types of functions shown above. However, understanding how these features are represented, created, and stored should give you a better understanding of how GIS works at a fundamental level.
